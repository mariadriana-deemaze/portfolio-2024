## Summary

AMA (Ask Me Anything) is a web platform, developed during Rocketseat's Tech Week, where users can create topic-based rooms to ask questions. These questions can receive likes from other users, making them more visible and of high interest.

The backend was built with Go, focusing on real-time communication using Gorilla WebSockets, allowing instant updates for users. It also includes Go-Chi for routing, database migrations, and PostgreSQL as the database engine.

On the frontend, the application uses React with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive UI. Data fetching and state management are handled with TanStack Query, ensuring smooth interaction with the Go API.
