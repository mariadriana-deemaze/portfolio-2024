## Summary

Eativity was an exploratory full-stack TypeScript mobile application built with React Native and Expo, and a NestJS backend. The user interface was designed using NativeBase, while the backend used Prisma ORM for database management.

The app featured user authentication, onboarding, profile management, recipe tracking, daily track logging, though some features remained experimental as this was primarily a hobby side-project - which has since been sunsetted.
